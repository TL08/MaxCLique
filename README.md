The problem of finding a maximum weighted clique is a generalization of the maximum clique problem of finding the clique with the maximum number of vertices. 
The max-clique decision problem is NP-hard: as such, unless P=NP, in the worst case any exact algorithm run for superpolynomial time before finding the solution.
We attempt to solve the Max-Clique problem using Gaussian Boson Sampling and Quantum Annealing using D-Wave.
